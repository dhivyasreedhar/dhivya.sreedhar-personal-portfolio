            Research intern under Prof. Prabu Mohandas, Dept of Computer Science and Engineering:
            * Worked on finding solutions for the challenging task of Music Instrument Recognition. Developed a model that labels unlabeled audio files so manual annotation can be avoided.
            * A Convolutional neural network and K nearest neighbors classifier framework were implemented to identify the musical instrument present in a    monophonic audio file and the performance of the two models are compared.
            * The model performed well with excellent result of 99.17% accuracy for the Convolutional Neural Network and 97% accuracy for the k-nearest neighbor architecture. Worked on finding solutions for the challenging task of Music Instrument Recognition. Developed a model that labels  unlabeled audio                files so that manual annotation can be avoided.
