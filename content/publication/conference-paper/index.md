abstract: Music instrument recognition is one of the main tasks of music
  information retrieval. Identification of instruments present in an audio track
  provides information about the composition of music. Music instrument
  recognition in polyphonic music is a challenging task. Existing approaches use
  temporal, spectral, and perceptual feature extraction techniques to perform
  music instrument recognition. In the proposed work, a convolutional neural
  network and k-nearest neighbor classifier framework are implemented to
  identify the musical instrument present in a monophonic audio file, and the
  performance of the two models is compared. The model is trained on the London
  Philharmonic Orchestra dataset which consists of six different classes of
  musical instruments. Mel spectrogram representation is used to extract
  features for the convolutional neural network model. For k-nearest neighbors,
  the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient’s feature vectors are calculated to
  perform classification. This approach only works for monophonic music and
  cannot be used for polyphonic music. The model helps to label the unlabelled
  audio files so that manual annotation can be avoided. The model performed well
  with excellent result of 99.17% accuracy for the convolutional neural network
  and 97% accuracy for the k-nearest neighbor architecture.
