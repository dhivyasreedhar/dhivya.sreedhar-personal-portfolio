title: Comparison of Deep Learning Techniques for Face Forgery
abstract: With the rapid advancement of digital media manipulation techniques, face forgery has emerged as a critical issue in today's digital age. The proliferation of sophisticated image and video editing tools, coupled with the increasing accessibility of deep learning algorithms, has made it easier than ever to create deceptive facial imagery. Face forgery, also known as deepfake, refers to the deliberate alteration or synthesis of facial images or videos to mislead viewers or manipulate information. In this research paper, we present a comparative study of four popular deep learning architectures, namely DenseNet, MobileNet, Xception and EfficientNet, for the detection of face forgery. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation and comparison, we aim to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage deep learning models for face forgery detection.
