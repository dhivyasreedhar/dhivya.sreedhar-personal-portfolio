title: Lane and Traffic Sign Detection in Self-Driving Cars using Deep Learning
abstract: With artificial intelligence technology progressing at a tremendous speed, intelligent driving has gotten a lot of recognition in recent years. Lane detection is one of the primary functions in self-driving cars.Traditionally, lane detection was done using image processing algorithms and computer vision techniques, which included extraction of areas which are possible lane areas, edge enhancement etc. Deep learning models with new improvements are being introduced till date. A self-driving car must also be able to identify traffic signs. In the proposed work a VGG-16 convolutional neural network is used for road segmentation. The model is trained on the KITTI Road/Lane Detection Evaluation 2013 dataset. The model performed well with an accuracy of 98.58 %. For traffic sign detection, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset is used. A convolutional neural network is used with ADAM optimizer, which gives an accuracy of 95%.
